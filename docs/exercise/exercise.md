# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: <15-651-177>

Project idea short description: 

A Blog, where the administrator can create/edit posts and viewers
may comment/like it.
The blog has an admin section (password protected, 3. priority) and a public section
The editor can add pictures, texts
Nice to have: Polls

## Project confirmation

Confirmed.

Cool project. 
It requires the user to identify as admin, editor, maybe other(?)
Proper identification is difficult. You best keep it as simple as possible.
For this kind of exercise it would be ok if the user just selects his role himself.
