# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: <15-651-177>

Project idea short description: 

A Blog, where the administrator can create/edit posts and viewers
may comment/like it.
The blog has an admin section (password protected, 3. priority) and a public section
The editor can add pictures, texts
Nice to have: Polls

## Project confirmation

Confirmed.

Cool project. 
It requires the user to identify as admin, editor, maybe other(?)
Proper identification is difficult. You best keep it as simple as possible.
For this kind of exercise it would be ok if the user just selects his role himself.

Other comment: 

I'm particular proud of: my Logo, the usage of Grails


## Project grading 

Description HTML is very basic but fully valid (not even warnings).
All works fine, except that posts are shown even though the publication date
is not yet reached.

Functionality:
Basic navigation. User input with basic, syntatic validation and
interactive display of validation by means of Grails.
CRUD functionality for a two-class domain with a one-to-many relationship.

Engineering:
Commit log is fine. 
Unit tests cover the posting logic nicely. It would have been nice to see tests for the
commenting feature or integration tests.
The HTML is valid with tiny exceptions (A document must not include both a meta element with an http-equiv attribute whose value is content-type, and a meta element with a charset attribute).
Commenting and Naming is ok.
Nice use of Grails features, e.g. layout to avoid duplication.

I award two extra points for the artistic value.
Since we are hitting the ceiling anyway, I spare the effort of awarding more possible extra points.

Congratulations!
You have created a full, distributed, DB-based, multi-user, interactive web application from scratch
all on your own. You achieved a nice, polished result that shines with clean, engaging design
that shows your attention to detail. Moreover the application is cleanly structured, makes very good
use of the Grails framework, uses Web MVC, and comes with a comprehensive test suite.
Should you ever need work examples to show in a job application, you can use this project.

Total Grade: 6.0
